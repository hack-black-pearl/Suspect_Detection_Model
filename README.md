# Suspect_Detection_Model
<h1 align ="center">Suspect Detection Model</h1><hr>
 
### This model analyses the human face when implemented using OpenCV. It is a pre-trained model which is used to analyse and evaluate emotion based on the  faces in an image or a video along with age prediction and gender detection.



## Features

- Face Recognition
- Criminal Records Database
- Body Language Detection
- Real-Time Analysis
- Machine Learning
- Privacy Considerations

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Used By

#### This project has been tried and tested by Uttar Pradesh Police Training Grounds, along with that many students and faculty also have tested for the same.

## Future Scope

- Combination of information from multiple sources, such as audio, video, and additional sensor data (e.g., infrared, depth sensors) for a more comprehensive understanding of a situation and improve overall accuracy.
- Implementation of Context-Aware Analysis to analyze the context of a scene, taking into account environmental factors, time of day, and other contextual information.
- Implementation of Arms and Weapon Detection within crowds for identifying unusual or suspicious patterns within large crowds, adding an extra layer of security in crowded environments.
